Sorting algorithms and Big O
Example of sorting algorithms:
Bubble sort
Selection Sorting
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour
of function when the argument tends towards a particular value.
Its also a way to describe the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm
in terms of its input size.

O(1):Constant time
The algorithm does not depend on the input size

O(log n): Logarithmic time
Common in algorithm that divides the problem in half at each step

O(n): Linear time
The runtime grows linearly with input size

O(n log n)
Common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge and sort

O(n^2): Quadratic Time
Common in algorithms with nested iterations

O(2^n): Exponential time
Common in algorithms with recursive solutions that explore all possibilities

Reading Big O Expressions
O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2) < O(2^n)
